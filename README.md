 Software Development Lifecycle 
 
Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program begins with understanding the user's perspective and requirements. Creating "user stories" is a pivotal technique in this process, as it translates complex needs into clear, actionable objectives for the development team, focusing on the user's experience and desired outcomes. 

When developing programs, adopting an Agile approach allows for flexibility, continuous feedback, and iterative development. Incorporating practices like Scrum or Kanban can enhance responsiveness to change and improve product quality through regular reflections and adjustments.

Being a good team member in software development involves effective communication, collaboration, and a willingness to adapt. It means actively participating in team discussions, sharing knowledge, being open to feedback, and contributing to a positive, productive team environment.
